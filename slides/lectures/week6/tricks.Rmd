# Some useful packages

---
## reprex

The [**reprex**](https://reprex.tidyverse.org/) package helps produce *reproducible examples*
It is meant to provide runnable code when asking questions on StackOverflow, Github Issues, or even Slack or e-mail. 

When you ask a question about a problem you're having in R, it's best to provide a 
[minimal reproducible](https://yihui.org/en/2017/09/the-minimal-reprex-paradox/) [example](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5963269/how-to-make-a-great-r-reproducible-example). This allows you to actually try to identify the problem, and allows a helper to 
reproduce the problem with minimal fuss.

               x = ~Sepal.Length, 
               y = ~Petal.Length, 
               color = ~Species)
