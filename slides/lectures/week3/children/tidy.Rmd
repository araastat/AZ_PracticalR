## Tidy data

<div style="display:flex;align-items:center;font-size:30pt;font-family:'Roboto Slab';width:100%;height:300px;background-color:wheat;text-align:center;padding-left: 50px; padding-right: 0px;border: 1px solid red; position: relative;">

Tidy datasets are all alike, <br/>
but every messy data is messy in its own way

## Tidy data

Tidy data is a **computer-friendly** format based on the following characteristics:

- Each row is one observation
- Each column is one variable
- Each set of observational unit forms a table

All other forms of data can be considered **messy data**.

---

## Let us count the ways

There are many ways data can be messy. An incomplete list....

+ Column headers are values, not variables
+ Multiple variables are stored in a single column
+ Variables are stored in both rows and columns
+ Multiple types of observational units are saved in the same table
+ A single observational unit is stored in multiple tables

---

## Ways to have messy (i.e. not tidy) data

1. Column headers contain values

Country   |   < $10K    | $10-20K    | $20-50K   | $50-100K    | > $100K
----------|-------------|------------|-----------|-------------|---------
India     |   40        |  25        |   25      |  9          |  1
USA       |   20        |  20        |  20       | 30          |  10

## Ways to have messy (i.e. not tidy) data

Column headers contain values

Country   |   Income  | Percentage
----------|-----------|------------
India     |  < $10K   |  40
USA       |  < $10K   | 20

This is a case of reshaping or melting

## Ways to have messy (i.e. not tidy) data

Multiple variables in one column

Country  | Year   | M_0-14  | F_0-14  | M_ 15-60  | F_15-60  | M_60+  | F_60+
---------|--------|---------|---------|-----------|----------|--------|-------
UK       |  2010  |         |         |           |          |        | 
UK       |  2011  |         |         |           |          |        |

Separating columns into different variables

## Tidying data

The typical steps are 

+ Transforming data from wide to tall (`pivot_longer`) and from tall to wide (`pivot_wider`)
+ Separating columns into different columns (`separate`)
+ Putting columns together into new variables (`unite`)

----
>The functions `pivot_longer` and `pivot_wider` supercede the older functions `gather` and `spread`, 
which I have used in previous iterations of this class. However, if you are familiar with `gather` and `spread`, they aren't gone and can still be used in the current **tidyr** package.

## Tidy data

```{r }
table1
```

Is this tidy?

---

## Tidy data

```{r }
table2
```

Is this tidy?

---

## Tidy data

```{r }
table3
```

Is this tidy?

## Tidy data

```{r }
table4a # cases
table4b # population
```

Are these tidy?

## Can we make datasets tidy?

Sometimes. The functions in the `tidyr` package can help

- `separate` is a function that can split a column into multiple columns
    - When there are multiple variables together in a column
    
```{r }
table3
```

We need to separate `rate` into two variables, cases and population

## Can we make datasets tidy?

```{r }
separate(table3, col = rate, into = c("cases", "population"), 
         sep = "/", 
         convert = TRUE) # convert type if possible 
```

> I've been explicit about naming all the options. R functions can work by 
position as well, so `separate(table3, rate, c('cases','population'), '/')` would work, but it's not very clear, is it?

## Can we make datasets tidy?

```{r }
table2
```

Here there are observations on two variables in successive rows

---

## Can we make datasets tidy?

We need to `spread` these rows out into different columns. This function is now called `pivot_wider`.

.pull-left[
![](../img/tidyr-spread-gather.gif)
]
.pull-right[
```{r }
pivot_wider(table2, names_from = type, values_from = count)
```
]

---

## Can we make datasets tidy?

```{r }
table4a
```

Here, the variable for year is stored as a header, not as data in a cell.

We need to `gather` that data and put it into a column. This function is now called `pivot_longer`

---

## Can we make datasets tidy?

.pull-left[
![](../img/tidyr-spread-gather.gif)
]

.pull-right[
```{r }
pivot_longer(table4a, names_to = 'year', values_to  = 'cases', 
    cols = c(`1999`, `2000`))
```
]

## Making data tidy

Admittedly, `pivot_wider` and `pivot_longer` are not easy concepts, but we'll practice with them more. 

1. `pivot_longer` collects multiple columns into 2, and only 2 columns
    - One column represents the data in the column headers
    - One column represents the values in the column
    - All other columns are repeated to keep all the data properly associated
1. `pivot_wider` takes two columns and makes them multiple columns
    - The values in one column form the headers to different new columns
    - The values in the other column represent the values in the corresponding cells
    - The other columns are repeated to start with, but reduce repetitions to make all associated data stay together
