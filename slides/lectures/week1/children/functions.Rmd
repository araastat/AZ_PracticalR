# Functions

---

## Why do we need functions?

When you are typing instructions to the computer, you might find yourself repeating the same instructions over and over. So you end up copying and pasting code for each repitition.

+ Can make a mistake copying and pasting
+ If you need to change the instructions, you need to find every instance of it **manually** and change it, and you're likely to miss one

The rule of thumb is, if you're copying the same code more than twice, write a function.

+ Write the instructions once
+ Change it in only one place, if needed

```{r, include=F}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo=T)
```

---

## Defining functions

The basic syntax of a function is 

```
<function name> <- function(<input argument(s)>){
  <code for instructions>
  ...
  <more code>
  return(<output object>)
}
```

---

## Defining functions

Let's create our own function to convert feet to inches.

```{r}
ft2in <- function(ft){
  inch <- ft * 12
  return(inch)
}
```

+ `ft2in` is the name of the function
+ The input argument is named `ft` (make an expressive name)
+ Inches are computed by multiplying `ft` by 12 and storing it in `inch`
+ The output of the function is the value of the `inch` variable

To run this:

.pull-left[
```{r a1, eval = F, echo = T}
ft2in(12) # 12 feet to inches
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r, eval=T, echo = F, ref.label="a1"}
```
]

---

## Defining functions

What if we want more than one input?

```{r, echo=T}
ft2in <- function(ft, convert_to){
  # ft = input (feet)
  # convert_to = unit to convert to ('in','m','cm')
  if(convert_to == 'in'){
    output <- ft * 12
  }
  if(convert_to == 'm'){
    output <- ft * 0.3048
  }
  if(convert_to == 'cm'){
    output <- ft * 30.48
  }
  return(paste(output, convert_to))
}
```

.pull-left[
```{r f2, eval = F, echo = T}
ft2in(12, convert_to='cm')
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r, eval=T, echo = F, ref.label="f2"}
```
]

## The concept of local vs global variables

```{r}
x <-  10
print(x)

f <- function(x){
  x <- 5
  print(x)
}

f(x)

print(x)
```

The `x` inside the function is local to the function and is independent of the `x` in the global space that has the value 10..

# Checking conditions: if / ifelse

---

## Checking conditions

We already saw an example of checking conditions with the `case_when` function.

Generally, we want to check conditions in order to do different things when different conditions are met. 

---

## Checking conditions

The general structure for this is the `if` statement:

```{r, eval=F}
if(condtion is met){
  do these things
} else{
  do these things
}
```

For example:

```{r}
letter <- 'b'

if(letter %in% c('a','e','i','o','u')){
  print('This is a vowel')
} else {
  print("This is a consonant")
}

```

---

## Checking conditions

You can check multiple conditions at once

```{r}
x <- 10

if(x %% 2 == 0 & (x %% 5 == 0)){
  print('x is divisible by 10')
} else if (x %% 2 == 0){
  print('x is even')
} else {
  print('x is odd')
}
```

---

## Checking conditions

One of R's advantages is that it can operate functions on arrays (vectors) of numbers. 
Taking advantage of that, if you only need to check one of two conditions, you can use the function `ifelse`.

```{r}
x <- c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10)

ifelse(x %% 2 == 0, 'even', 'odd')
```

## Quick reminder about conditions

Some comparison operators for filtering

| Operator | Meaning                          |
|----------|----------------------------------|
| ==       | Equals                           |
| !=       | Not equals                       |
| > / <    | Greater / less than              |
| >= / <=  | Greater or equal / Less or equal |
| !        | Not                              |
| %in%     | In a set                         |

Combining comparisons

| Operator   | Meaning |
|------------|---------|
| &          | And     |
| &#124;       | Or      |

# Loops

## for-loops

## for-loops

The for-loop is a construct to repeat the same operation over a list of values.

Basic syntax:

```
for(<variable> in <list>){
    <code>
    ...
    <more code>
}
```

Example:

.pull-left[
```{r loop1, eval = F, echo = T}
for(i in 1:10){
  print(i)
}
```

Here `i` is a dummy variable. It's actual name doesn't matter, just its action
]
.pull-right[
```{r, eval=T, echo = F, ref.label="loop1"}
```
]

---

## for-loops

Example:

```{r}
for(n in names(iris)){
  if(is.numeric(iris[,n])){
    print(paste0('The mean of ', n, ' is ', mean(iris[,n]))) #<<
  }
}
```

You don't need the `<list>` in the for-loop definition to be integers. In this case it is a list of strings.

Note that vectors are also considered lists for this purpose.
